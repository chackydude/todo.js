# todo.js app
is my pet JS project, to repeat OOP.

Here I tried to use MVC-pattern (Model-View-Controller)

![scheme of MVC pattern](https://github.com/chackydude/todo.js/raw/master/MVC.png)

Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements: 
*Model
*View
*Controller
