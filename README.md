# todo.js app
is my pet JS project, to repeat OOP.

Here I tried to use MVC-pattern (Model-View-Controller)

![scheme of MVC pattern](https://github.com/chackydude/todo.js/raw/master/MVC.png)
Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.

### Model
The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
### View
Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
### Controller
Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
